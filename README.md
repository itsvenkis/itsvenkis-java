My projects
Data Structures
Java Collections packages has implementations based on different types of Binary trees like Red-Black and binary heap
trees(Sets and priority queues) but the trees are hidden in the implementation. Whenever a reuirement demands a binary tree
one ends up creating their our own classes to support the requirements. This projects aims to provide a good implementation and 
definitions of various kinds of binary trees.
